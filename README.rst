sqlalchemy-vertica
Vertica dialect for sqlalchemy.

Forked from the sqlalchemy-vertica repository <https://github.com/startappdev/sqlalchemy-vertica>. Unfortunately, sqlalchemy-vertica was removed from pypi. As of Sept 28, 2018 this version supports querying views. This is version is not a state of the art, nor does it follow the principles outlinedb by SQLAlchemy at:https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/blob/master/README.dialects.rst. However, I will slowly start upgrading the code base to meet standards and submit so that it becomes an external dialect in SQLAlchemy. Anyone interested in helping is welcome to contribute and/or submit issues/ideas.

import sqlalchemy as sa
import urllib
# for pyodbc connection
sa.create_engine('vertica+pyodbc:///?odbc_connect=%s' % (urllib.quote('DSN=dsn'),))

# for turbodbc connection
sa.create_engine('vertica+turbodbc:///?DSN=dsn')

# for vertica-python connection
sa.create_engine('vertica+vertica_python://user:pwd@host:port/database')
